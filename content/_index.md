As a frontend developer, I value close collaboration and thoughtful technological decisions to create user-centered interfaces with real impact.

A respectful team culture is just as important to me as the opportunity to contribute with focus, drive, and a strong sense of responsibility.

In a trusting and human work environment, I enjoy combining my relaxed nature with reliable and focused execution.
